# Forest Fire Predictor using OpenCV :fire:

## Problem
- Forest fires have been increasing and causing serious damage all over the world. 
- Over the past 10 years, there have been an **annual average of 67,000 forest fires and 7 million acres burned**. 
- With these losses, the suppression costs are seen to have an average of **$2 million a year**. 
- Although forest fires can be spotted and extinguished, it depends on the size of the fire when it comes to losses. 
- They can have a devastating impact on the acres they affect, the lives they affect, and the structures they destroy.

## Solution
- We are using **YOLO to identify the risk of an area** contributing to a forest fire based on the nature of the objects present. 
- By identifying and classifying various items such as trees, rocks, grass, and water, we can accurately develop a model to tell us the risk of fire spreading in that particular area. 
- This system can be integrated into almost any smartphone, which many fire departments already supply. 
- This will help firefighters to more accurately combat high risk areas of the fire and prevent them from missing critical information. 
- The data from smartphones can be captured and relayed to other systems, like the **national arcGIS Wildfire Public Information Dashboard**, through existing apps from ESRI, the company that develops the arcGIS software. 
- From there, the data can be used by **firefighters, scientists, government officials**, and other individuals to help combat any wildfires based on the locations where they receive data from. 
- This data can even be overlayed into larger maps that model wind speed and weather patterns so firefighting resources can be more effectively used.
