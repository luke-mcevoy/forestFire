## Fundamentals of Machine Learning

### Supervised/Unsupervised Learning
ML systems can be classified according to the amount and type of supervision they get during training. 
There are four major categories:
- Supervised learning
    - In supervised learning, the training set you feed to the algorithm includes the dresired solutions called labels.
    - A typical supervised learning task is classification.
    - k-Nearest Neighbors
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
    - Decision Trees and Random Forests
    - Neural Networks
- Unsupervised learning
    - In unsupervised learning, the training data is unlabeled. The system tries to learn without a teacher.
    - Clustering
        - K-Means
        - DBSCAN
        - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
    - Anomaly detection and novelty detection
        - One-class SVM
        - Isolation Forest
    - Visualization and dimensionality reduction
        - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
        - Kernel PCA
        - Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
        - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
    - Aasociation rule learning
        - Apriori
        - Eclat
- Semisupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning
